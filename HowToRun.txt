To run, pip install pygame and perlin, 
(if you don't know how to do it, there is an another text file in this folder, CHECK IT OUT and then come back), 
then in the game files go to Melta > code > run.py <- run.py <- double click run.py to play the game! 
(run.py might be just run on your device, so just double click run)

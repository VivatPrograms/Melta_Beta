To install pip, you have to go to this exact link on your browser >>> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe <<<
or just search up python and download it from the website yourself (if the link is outdated or the python version is outdated, which at the time is not)
It is a Python installation which you need for the game to work, then when you have it installed search commannd prompt in the windows search.
Then in the terminal write pip install pygame and then pip install perlin.
Thats it, now you can go back to HowToRun.txt and launch the game. I hope.
